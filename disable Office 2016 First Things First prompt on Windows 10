I have installed Office onto 100+ machines. Is there a way to accept the "First Things First" 
(http://imgur.com/a/QqPob) message that appears when an office application is first opened, 
without having to go to each machine, open an office program and accepting it? Is it possible 
to accept it automatically through the registry or by a group policy? I have be looking for
answers to this for some time now but I am getting no where.
I have tried adding all the below recommended keys to the registry but none seem to help:

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\General] "shownfirstrunoptin"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\FirstRun] "BootedRTM"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Registration] "AcceptAllEulas"=dword:00000001
